""" This is a Python code that defines a function named "isTripleConsecutive" which takes a word as an input and returns 
True if the word has three consecutive letters that are consecutive letters in the alphabet, and False otherwise.
The function is implemented using a for loop that iterates over the characters in the word, comparing each character
with the two next ones to check if they form a sequence of three consecutive letters in the alphabet. The ord() function 
is used to convert each character to its ASCII code so that the comparison can be made using numerical values.
The code then prompts the user to enter a word, and uses the isTripleConsecutive function to determine whether the 
entered word has three consecutive letters that are consecutive letters in the alphabet. If the function returns True, 
the code prints "The word has three consecutive letters that are consecutive letters in the alphabet." Otherwise, it prints 
"The word does not have three consecutive letters that are consecutive letters in the alphabet
